    <p>Renewed hostilities have been raging between 
        Armenian and Azerbaijani forces around the contested 
        territory of Nagorno-Karabakh in the southern Caucasus.</p>
    <p>
        In scale and scope, the fighting that broke out on Sunday
         surpasses the periodic escalations of recent years, involving 
         heavy artillery, tanks, missiles and drones.
